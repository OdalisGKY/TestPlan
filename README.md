# TestPlan
This test plan is based on identifying an online web aplication and writting a test plan for a feature that includes at least 20 test cases.
Website Identified: www.odalisg.com
The feature from the website that was recently added to the application was a shopping cart.
Need to confirm that the purchasing process is working correctly.
An actual test plan will be created.
.CSV file will be imported which can be viewed by going to RAW view.
Once in raw view, copy the URL.
The file can viewed in RStudios.
Once in RStudio, type read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OdalisGKY/TestPlan/main/ActualTestPlan") and hit enter.
